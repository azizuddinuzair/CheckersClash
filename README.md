# Checkers Game with AI

Overview
  This is an AI-powered Checkers game built using Python. The game features an intelligent AI that plays the game using the Minimax algorithm, offering a challenging experience for players.

Features:
  - AI Player: The AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm for decision-making and strategic play.
  - Player vs. AI: Play against an AI or implement player-vs-player mode.
  - Terminal Interface: A text-based interface with simple instructions and move representations.

Installation:
Project is still under construction :)

How to Play:
  1. The game starts with a standard checkers board setup.
  2. Choose to play against the AI or another player.
  3. The game will display the board and ask for input on each move.
  4. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to calculate optimal moves, making it a challenging opponent.


Game Rules:
  - Players take turns moving their pieces diagonally.
  - The objective is to capture all of the opponentâ€™s pieces or block their moves.
  - Kings can move forward and backward across the board.

Future Goals:
  - 2-Player Chess: Build a chess game that allows two players to play against each other, either locally or online.
  - Chess Tutorial: Create an interactive tutorial for beginners to learn how to play chess, covering rules, strategies, and basic tactics.
  - Chess Puzzles: Implement a series of puzzles where players have to checkmate their opponent within one move, enhancing their tactical thinking.
